// Package modelbudget is a narrow counted-request accounting module shared by
// real consumers. It owns only windows, reservations and conservative
// consumption: no money settlement, no scheduling, no network. It never owns a
// pool and never begins, commits or rolls back a transaction — every function
// runs on the caller's tx.
